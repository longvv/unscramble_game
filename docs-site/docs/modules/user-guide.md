## Drag and Drop Interaction

The game uses a drag-and-drop interface that is intuitive and child-friendly:

### Dragging Letters

To drag a letter:
1. Click and hold on a letter tile
2. Move it to the desired position
3. Release to drop the letter

Letters can be moved:
- From the scrambled area to the drop area
- Between positions in the drop area
- Back to the scrambled area if you change your mind

### Tips for Dragging

- A subtle sound effect plays when dragging and dropping letters
- Letter tiles will snap into the letter boxes
- You can swap letters by dropping one tile onto another
- The game provides visual feedback when dragging over valid drop targets

## Using Hints

If you're stuck on a word, the hint feature can help:

1. Click the "Hint" button
2. The first letter of the word will automatically be placed in the correct position
3. Note that using a hint will reduce your points from 10 to 5 for that word

Hints are particularly useful for beginners or when learning new vocabulary.

## Celebration Effects

When you correctly solve a word:

1. A celebration animation appears
2. Sound effects play to reinforce your success
3. The image of the word is displayed
4. The word is pronounced
5. Your score increases
6. After a short delay, a new word is loaded

These multi-sensory celebrations help reinforce learning and create a positive association with vocabulary building.

## Customizing Word Lists

You can add your own words to personalize the learning experience:

2. Enter a new word in the text box
3. Optionally upload an image for the word:
