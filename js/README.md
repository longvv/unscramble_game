# Modular Code Architecture

This document describes the modular code architecture for the Word Scramble Game.

## Overview

The code has been refactored to follow SOLID principles and implement several design patterns to improve maintainability and extensibility. The major improvements include:

1. **Module Pattern**: Each JS file uses the module pattern to encapsulate private functionality
2. **Separation of Concerns**: Clear separation between different aspects of the application
3. **Dependency Management**: Explicit dependencies between modules
4. **Reusable Components**: UI elements and behaviors are reusable

## Module Structure

### 1. `config.js`
- Contains all configuration values
- Single source of truth for game settings
- Implements a simple getter interface

### 2. `storage.js`
- Handles data persistence using localStorage
- Implements the Repository Pattern
- Provides safe data access with error handling

### 3. `audio.js` 
- Manages all sound effects and pronunciation
- Error handling for audio playback
- Abstracts audio loading and playing

### 4. `ui-factory.js`
- Creates UI elements using the Factory Pattern
- Consistent UI element creation
- Attaches required event handlers to elements

### 5. `word-manager.js`
- Manages the word list and word images
- Handles adding, removing, and storing words
- Provides access to word data for the game

### 6. `drag-drop.js`
- Implements the drag and drop functionality
- Handles all drag and drop events
- Strategy Pattern for different drop targets

### 7. `game-controller.js`
- Orchestrates the game flow
- Coordinates between other modules
- Maintains game state

### 8. `main.js`
- Entry point for the application
- Initializes the game

## Design Patterns Used

### 1. Module Pattern
Each JavaScript file uses the module pattern to create private scope and expose only necessary functionality:

```javascript
const ModuleName = (function() {
    // Private variables and functions
    
    return {
        // Public API
    };
})();
```

### 2. Factory Pattern
The `UIFactory` module creates UI elements with consistent styling and functionality:

```javascript
createLetterTile: function(letter, dragStartCallback, dragEndCallback) {
    const tile = document.createElement('div');
    tile.className = 'letter-tile';
    tile.textContent = letter;
    // ... more setup ...
    return tile;
}
```

### 3. Repository Pattern
The `StorageService` module implements a repository pattern for data persistence:

```javascript
getWords: function() {
    return _safelyGetItem(
        GameConfig.get('storage').words, 
        GameConfig.get('defaultWords')
    );
}
```

### 4. Observer Pattern
While not explicitly implemented as a separate module, event handling follows the observer pattern through DOM event listeners.

### 5. Strategy Pattern
The `DragDropManager` uses different strategies for handling drops on different elements.

## SOLID Principles Applied

### Single Responsibility Principle
Each module has a single responsibility:
- `AudioService` - Handle sound playback
- `StorageService` - Manage data persistence
- `WordManager` - Manage words and images

### Open/Closed Principle
Modules are open for extension but closed for modification:
- New game features can be added by creating new modules
- Existing modules can be extended without modifying their internal implementation

### Liskov Substitution Principle
UI elements created by the `UIFactory` are consistent and can be used interchangeably where appropriate.

### Interface Segregation Principle
Public APIs are minimal and focused on specific use cases.

### Dependency Inversion Principle
High-level modules depend on abstractions, not concrete implementations:
- `GameController` depends on the public APIs of other modules, not their internal details
- Modules communicate through well-defined interfaces

## Extension Points

The architecture is designed to be easily extendable:

1. Add new game modes by creating new controller modules
2. Add new UI elements by extending the UIFactory
3. Add new sound effects by extending the AudioService
4. Implement new storage mechanisms by adapting the StorageService

## Conclusion

This modular architecture follows best practices for maintainable and extensible code. It separates concerns, manages dependencies, and provides clear interfaces between components.
